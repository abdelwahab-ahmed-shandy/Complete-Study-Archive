## TCP/IP Protocol Suite (Expanded)

TCP/IP is a protocol suite originally developed by the U.S. Department of Defense.

* It is the official standard of the internet.
* Supports communication between different OSs.
* Includes many protocols beyond TCP and IP:

  * HTTP / HTTPS
  * DNS
  * FTP / SFTP
  * SMTP / POP3 / IMAP
  * SSH / Telnet

### Difference between TCP/IP v4 and v6:

* **v4** uses 32-bit addressing (limited ‚Üí IPv4 exhaustion)
* **v6** uses 128-bit addressing

  * Better support for QoS and security
  * IPSec is built-in

## Major Protocols in Networking (Detailed)

| Protocol  | Vendor    | Routable  | Notes                             |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------------------------------- |
| TCP/IP    | Open Std  | ‚úÖ Yes     | Core protocol of the internet     |
| IPX/SPX   | Novell    | ‚úÖ Yes     | Previously used in Novell NetWare |
| NetBEUI   | Microsoft | ‚ùå No      | LAN only, non-routable, very fast |
| AppleTalk | Apple     | ‚úÖ Yes     | Deprecated since macOS X          |
| DLC       | IBM       | ‚ùå Partial | For old mainframe infrastructure  |

## OSI vs TCP/IP (Clarified)

* **OSI Model**: 7-layer theoretical framework
* **TCP/IP Model**: Practical 4-layer model

| OSI Layer        | Description                   | TCP/IP Equivalent |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Application (7)  | Applications like browsers    | Application       |
| Presentation (6) | Data format, encryption       | Application       |
| Session (5)      | Session control               | Application       |
| Transport (4)    | Reliable delivery (TCP/UDP)   | Transport         |
| Network (3)      | Routing, IP addressing        | Internet          |
| Data Link (2)    | MAC-level communication       | Network Access    |
| Physical (1)     | Electrical/Physical signaling | Network Access    |

---

## Data Encapsulation (In-depth)

Each layer adds its own header (control info):

```
[Application Data]
   ‚Üì
[+ Transport Header: TCP/UDP]
   ‚Üì
[+ Network Header: IP]
   ‚Üì
[+ Data Link Header: MAC (Ethernet)]
   ‚Üì
[Physical Transmission: 1s & 0s via cable/wireless]
```

---

## MAC & IP Addressing (Explained)

### MAC (Media Access Control):

* Hardcoded on NIC (Network Interface Card)
* Identifies device uniquely on LAN
* Cannot be changed easily

### IP Address:

* Logical address (static/dynamic)
* Used for routing between networks
* Can be changed

---

## IPv4 Addressing (Deeper Look)

* IPv4 = 2¬≥¬≤ ‚âà 4.29 billion addresses
* Each **octet** = 8 bits ‚Üí value range 0‚Äì255
* Example: `192.168.1.10`

  * Binary: `11000000.10101000.00000001.00001010`

## IP Classes (Analyzed)

| Class | Starting Bits | Host Bits | Max Hosts    | Notes                   |
| ----- | ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| A     | 0             | 24        | \~16 million | For large networks      |
| B     | 10            | 16        | \~65,000     | Medium-sized networks   |
| C     | 110           | 8         | 254          | Small networks          |
| D     | 1110          | N/A       | Multicast    | Not for host assignment |
| E     | 1111          | N/A       | Experimental | Reserved for research   |

---

## Private vs Public IP (Clarified)

* **Private IPs:**

  * Not directly reachable over internet
  * Used in homes/offices
  * Require NAT to access the internet

* **Public IPs:**

  * Assigned by ISPs
  * Must be globally unique

---

## DHCP & APIPA (Expanded)

### DHCP ‚Äì Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol:

* Automatically assigns:

  * IP address
  * Subnet mask
  * Default gateway
  * DNS server
* Process (DORA):

  * Discover ‚Üí Offer ‚Üí Request ‚Üí Acknowledge

### APIPA ‚Äì Automatic Private IP Addressing:

* Used when DHCP is unreachable
* Address range: 169.254.0.1 ‚Äì 169.254.255.254

---

## Reserved IPs (Functions)

| Usage Type      | Example       | Function                       |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Network ID      | 192.168.1.0   | Identifies the network         |
| Broadcast       | 192.168.1.255 | Send to all devices on subnet  |
