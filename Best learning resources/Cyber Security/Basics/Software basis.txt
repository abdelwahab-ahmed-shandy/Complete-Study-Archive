You have to learn some important basics in the field of professional programming in general. I do not advise starting with Python as many claim so that you do not get shocked in the future.
 I advise this map. From it, you will learn programming correctly. 
 From it, it did not hinder your learning of cybersecurity,
 but it supported you in software in a better way. I hope that you listen to my advice and do not make mistakes as I made.
 You will learn a complete track from this link. At the end of it,
 you will be able to create a desktop application. If you complete the map, 
 it is for yourself. If you do not complete it, take from it what will establish you in general.
 My personal vision is that the foundation is no less than specialization in something.
 You must complete the entire map. This is my personal advice. 
 
 You will learn first C++, then OB, then C# and databases in a very deep way, then you will do many good projects, 
 and on the way or on this journey you will do small and large projects and you will understand what programming challenges are and how to solve them. 
 I wish you success and I hope that you listen to this advice so that you do not regret it in the future.

 After you finish course number 4, you will complete the rest of the map here. By the way,
 there are discounts for those who cannot pay the price of the course.
 There are discount codes available on the platform that reach 100% for those who cannot pay these prices, 
 but I ask you to be very honest in this matter.
