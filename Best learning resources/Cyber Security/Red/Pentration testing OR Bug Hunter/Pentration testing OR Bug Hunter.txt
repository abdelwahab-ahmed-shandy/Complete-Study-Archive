Here are the best sources I came across during the entire journey and during my research as well:

First, there is a course that takes you from the beginning, 
from the basics, to practical application on websites in an effective manner.
It is a paid course on Udemy. 
This is its link :
https://www.udemy.com/course/red-teaming/



I prefer you start with the course above, but let's assume that you want to go deeper or want more free sources,
so I will put some links that you can learn from, which are the best courses in the Arab world in this track.

Try to start these links in order, otherwise you may get lost because some of them are explained in a slightly advanced way.
